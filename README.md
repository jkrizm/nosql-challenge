# nosql-challenge

all code for the assignment has been added to the NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb and NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb. The original .json file has been uploaded in the resources folder. 
Note that because of how I had my folder structure organized, I used the full path to the establishments.json file, as can be seen in the first markdown cell of NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb
